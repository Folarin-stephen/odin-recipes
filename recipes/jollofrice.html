    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Jollof rice is the most popular food in Africa and, the required ingredients are abundant in most countries of the world.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1kg Chicken/beef</li>
        <li>1000ml of Ground Fresh tomatoes.</li>
        <li>50ml Ground Fresh peppers</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup of sliced onions</li>
        <li>300ml vegetable</li>
        <li>salt to taste.</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 fingers of ginger</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes. Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.</li>
        <li>Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls. Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.</li>
        <li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.</li>
        <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>
        <li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes. I like to cook jollof rice with the same oil I used while frying the meat.Using a fresh oil is just the same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually holds over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian foods.The end result is not the same.</li>
        <li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon.You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.</li>
        <li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock) to the fried tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.</li>
        <li>Allow the stock to boil for 10 minutes, then add the parboiled rice, stir and taste again. It should still taste overly spiced. If not, add more salt and seasoning cubes to your taste.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to the lowest, cover the pot with a foil paper and then cover with the pot lid. Allow to cook for 20 minutes, after which you would open the pot and stir gently with a fork, then cover again and allow to cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the 10 minutes, open the pot and check if  the rice is well cooked, if not, cover and allow to cook for another 5-10 minutes. Once the rice is well cooked, add the fried chicken/beef on top of the rice, cover and allow to stay for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve with fried plantain, coleslaw, or any salad of your choice.</li>
